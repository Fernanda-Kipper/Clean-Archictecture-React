<b>This application consists in a polling platform for programmers with login but its main objective is to apply the concepts of Clean Architecture and Test Driven Development in a Frontend application using React JS</b>
</p>


<h2 id="tech">Technologies</h2>
  This application architecture is organized in the following lawyers:

  - **Domain** - the use cases of the application AK business rules
  - **Infrastructure** - implementation of dependencies of the domain some times using third party libraries, making the domain layer decoupled from the implementation with 3rd party libraries 
  - **Presentation** - interface, presentation responsible for making the communication of your use cases to users
  - **Main** - unique location in an application where modules are composed together
